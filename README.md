# Juego de orden #
## Â¿What's the project about? ##
This group project, originally made in [Python][original], was developed as a final project for my Algorithms and Programming Structures course in my university.

It's a game called "Juego de Orden" where the objective is to set every 0 in the square as a 1 in order to win the game.

## Who made this? ##
This was [one of my collegues][author]' idea so the whole group both put our hands into making it possible. I only re-did the project as a means to practice and improve my Java skills.

## Is it finished? ##
Version 1.0 is out but as time goes by, I am thinking into optimizing it and further add to it. Again, all of this with the objective of improving my Java skills.
